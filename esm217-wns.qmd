# Abstract

Here, we investigate the impacts to crop production from an infectious fungal disease affecting bats.The fungus *Pseudogymnoascus destructans* causes white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats and has spread across the United States. Declining bat populations are expected to have substantial impacts on the environment, specifically agriculture. Bats eat insects that damage crops and the consumption of these insects by bats saves farmers billions of dollars in pest control services annually. We map white-nose syndrome occurrence and pesticide use by county across the US. The white-nose syndrome data from USGS is a time series of categorical presence/absence data of the disease and fungus. The pesticide use data is a time series of continuous concentration data by US counties. We run a linear regression to quantify the relationship between white-nose syndrome detection and pesticide use. We suggest next steps move towards incorporating public health data and running a multivariate analysis between WNS status, pesticide use, and negative health outcomes.

# Background

White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease caused by the invasive European fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Pd and WNS were first detected in the U.S. in 2007.WNS has killed off over 90% of the total populations of at least 3 species (Myotis septentrionalis, Myotis lucifugus, and Perimyotis subflavus) and heavily impacted others. Pd grows on the walls of caves, and can be spread between caves by both bats and human activity.

At the population scale, bats serve as natural pest control by eating insects that would otherwise feed on crops.Bat die-offs from WNS likely lead to increased need for pesticides. Many pesticides are linked to increased infant mortality.

Our research question: Does pesticide use increase following detection of Pd or WNS?

# Methods

To investigate the relationship between White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) in bats and pesticide use in agriculture, we compiled and processed datasets from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). WNS occurrence data was obtained at the county level, categorizing locations based on the presence of *Pseudogymnoascus destructans* (Pd) and confirmed WNS cases. Pesticide use data, available as continuous concentration estimates, was aggregated by county and standardized by land area to facilitate comparisons. These datasets were integrated with U.S. county shapefiles to ensure spatial consistency for mapping and analysis.

Data visualization played a key role in our analysis. We created a bivariate map to identify regions where both factors co-occur. This map provided a clear spatial representation of potential associations between WNS prevalence and increased pesticide application.

To quantify this relationship, we conducted a linear regression analysis, treating WNS status as the independent variable and pesticide use per square meter as the dependent variable. This allowed us to assess whether counties with higher WNS detections also exhibited increased pesticide use.

Through this methodological approach, we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the link between WNS-related bat population declines, increased pesticide reliance, and potential consequences for both agriculture and public health.

# Discussion

-   Our research question: Does pesticide use increase following detection of Pd or WNS?

-   Conclusion: Yes.

What about solutions?

-   Protect Bat Habitat

    -   Conserve remaining Pd-negative caves and surrounding bat habitat.

    -   Man-made structures can be modified or built to provide Pd-free bat habitat.

-   Pd Spread Prevention

    -   Pd spread can be slowed and stopped by excluding human activity from caves.

    -   Caves can be inoculated against Pd with limited efficacy.

-   WNS Prevention

    -   Bats can be inoculated against WNS with limited efficacy.

# Next Steps

We suggest moving towards incorporating public health data and running a multivariate analysis between WNS status, pesticide use, and negative health outcomes.
