# Proposal

We will investigate the impacts to crop production from an infectious fungal disease affecting bats.The fungus *Pseudogymnoascus destructans* causes white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats and has spread across the United States. Declining bat populations are expected to have substantial impacts on the environment, specifically agriculture. Bats eat insects that damage crops and the consumption of these insects by bats saves farmers billions of dollars in pest control services annually. We will map white-nose syndrome occurrence and pesticide use by county across the US. The white-nose syndrome data from USGS is a time series of categorical presence/absence data of the disease and fungus. The pesticide use data is a time series of continuous concentration data by US counties. We will run a linear regression to quantify the relationship between white-nose syndrome detection and pesticide use. Time allowing, we will take it a step further by incorporating public health data and run a linear regression between pesticide use and negative health outcomes.

# Background

-   Importance of bats as biological pest control

-   Emergence of WNS and spread across US

-   Effects of declining bat populations on agriculture/economics and increased pesticide use

-   Impacts of increased pesticide use on human health

# Methods

To investigate the relationship between White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) in bats and pesticide use in agriculture, we compiled and processed datasets from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). WNS occurrence data was obtained at the county level, categorizing locations based on the presence of *Pseudogymnoascus destructans* (Pd) and confirmed WNS cases. Pesticide use data, available as continuous concentration estimates, was aggregated by county and standardized by land area to facilitate comparisons. These datasets were integrated with U.S. county shapefiles to ensure spatial consistency for mapping and analysis.

Data visualization played a key role in our analysis. We created a bivariate map to identify regions where both factors co-occur. This map provided a clear spatial representation of potential associations between WNS prevalence and increased pesticide application.

To quantify this relationship, we conducted a linear regression analysis, treating WNS status as the independent variable and pesticide use per square meter as the dependent variable. This allowed us to assess whether counties with higher WNS detections also exhibited increased pesticide use. Additionally, to explore potential broader ecological and public health impacts, we incorporated infant mortality data and examined its correlation with pesticide exposure.

Through this methodological approach, we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the link between WNS-related bat population declines, increased pesticide reliance, and potential consequences for both agriculture and public health.

-   Impacts of WNS spread on agriculture and human health

-   Planetary health solution of biological pest control rather than increased pesticide use
